# Overview

MonsterValley is a game inspired by Pok√©mon and Stardew Valley. The game takes place with the player losing either their parents or grandparents and recieve a house and farm in a town (name pending) located in a valley (name pending) which was dubbed the "Monster Valley" because of the strange mutation to the animals which gave them some monster-like properties, affecting their aggresiveness and behaviors. The player then takes part in a tournament to save the town when their former employer attempts to re-purpose the town for some nefarious money-making purpose.

# Key Mechanics

## Pemo

Players can tame monsters which are refered to as "Pemo" or "Pet Monsters". These Pemo can battle other wild monsters and will eventually have animal by-products like eggs or milk which can be sold. Pemo can also help with chopping trees, breaking stones, plowing fields and planting as well as watering crops.

## Farming

Players can also farm berries, and potentially other crops (this mechanic is still going through changes to its implementation before being officially coded in.) and sell them in town for money. Players will be able to use their Pemo to help them with farming and some Pemo will have animal by-products like milk, eggs, etc. which can also be sold.

# Development Environment

I used Unity for this project with VS Code as my IDE for scritping and Piskel for pixel art. The project is written in C#.

# University Assignments

Although this particular project was not made for any university assignments in particular, I decided to use it in one of my classes to expand on my knowledge of C# and Game development. After the class is over, I will keep the following as a record of what I learned while developing this game, but will set the project back to private most likely. Please respect this and do not use my code or art as these are things that I have put many hours into and hope to have this made into a commercial project in the future.

# About Me

My name is Will Marda, I have been programming for about 15+ years now. I have been facinated by video games and have been focusing most of those 15 years on Game Development, 2D and 3D art and animation using pixel or low-poly art styles. When I first started, I used a program called Game Maker which eventually because known as Game Maker Studio and eventually Game Maker Studio 2. I used this tool all through highschool, completing 3 games. I returned from serving a mission for my church and used this tool to complete 1 more game before moving on to Unity and C#.
